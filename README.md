# Remote Dictionary Server (redis)

Q: What is the best way to learn redis?

Q: Are keys unique to each database?

Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
KEYS *

SELECT 0
+OK
GET xlgmokha
$-1
SET xlgmokha "was here"
+OK
GET xlgmokha
$8
was here
SELECT 1
+OK
GET xlgmokha
$-1
SET xlgmokha "dissappear"
+OK
GET xlgmokha
$10
dissappear
SELECT 0
+OK
GET xlgmokha
$8
was here
QUIT
+OK
Connection closed by foreign host.
```
